/*
 * ZzFX sample builder, vendored from ZzFX v1.4.0 by Frank Force.
 * https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX
 *
 * Only `buildSamples`, unchanged apart from taking the sample rate as an
 * argument. The npm package creates an AudioContext the moment it is imported,
 * which breaks under jsdom (no Web Audio) and makes browsers warn about
 * autoplay on every page load. The app's own sound service owns the one
 * AudioContext and creates it on the first tap.
 *
 * Parameter arrays from the ZzFX designer (https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/)
 * paste straight into `config/sounds.js`.
