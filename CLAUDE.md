# CLAUDE.md

This is the primary project brief for AI agents working in this repository. Read it before answering questions, proposing changes, or editing code.

## Mandatory workflow

1. Read this file first.
2. Decide whether the task belongs in the frontend repo or the sibling API repo.
3. Reuse existing project patterns instead of inventing new ones.
4. Keep backend logic out of this repo unless the change is truly frontend-only.
5. Validate with the smallest relevant command before finishing.

## Project boundary

This repository is the frontend app only.

The real backend lives in the sibling repo:
C:\Nuno\Projects\GrasshopperWebSite\proxies\multi-lingo-ai-api

This frontend talks to that backend through the shared proxy wrapper and the VITE_PROXY_URL value. It is the client/UI layer only.

Any task involving auth, Firestore, AI requests, subscriptions, billing, storage, quotas, or data writes should be checked against the API repo before implementation.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
npm run lint
```

There is no project test suite configured; do not assume one exists.

## Architecture summary

- Vite + React SPA
- React Router v6
- Single global store in src/contexts/AppContext.jsx
- Firebase Auth only in the frontend; no Firestore/Storage SDK usage on the client
- All backend data access goes through the sibling API repo via apiFetch and the proxy layer

## Critical repo rules

- Use src/services/apiClient.js and apiFetch for backend requests instead of raw fetch.
- Treat the sibling API repo as the source of truth for backend behavior, Firestore access, storage, AI quotas, and Stripe logic.
- Do not hardcode user-facing strings; use the translation pipeline and existing i18n keys.
- Reuse shared components before creating new UI.
- Follow the route guard and lazy-loaded dashboard patterns already used in src/App.jsx.
- Run npm run lint after frontend edits and resolve warnings before considering the work done.

## i18n workflow

This project loads locales from Firestore and then syncs them into i18next. The key rules are:

- Keep locale loading dynamic; do not assume a static list is enough.
- Use the existing translation loading flow instead of inventing a new one.
- Do not add a hardcoded supportedLngs list unless the existing behavior is deliberately reworked.
- Use the translation service and existing keys before adding new strings.
- When working on locale loading, follow the i18n skill in .github/skills/i18n/SKILL.md.

## Backend contract to remember

If a task touches any of the following, inspect the sibling API repo before deciding on the fix:

- /api/auth
- /api/firestore
- /api/storage
- /api/ask-ai
- /api/stripe

## User-scoped list data: "seen" vs "favourites"

Two different mechanisms keep arrays of ids on the user's own `users/{uid}`
document. Do not conflate them or share fields between them.

**Seen ids** — `src/services/userService.js`, fields named `seen*`
(`seenConceptIds`, `seenStoryIds`, `seenHistoryFactsIds`, ...). Append-only
progress tracking, so the app can stop serving content a user has already had.
Ids go in one at a time and only come out via a wholesale reset. There is
deliberately no "remove one" — un-seeing a single item is meaningless.

**Favourites** — `src/services/favouritesService.js`, fields named `fav*`
(`favGrammarTipIds`, `favStoryIds`, `favWordIds`). A user-curated list behind a
heart toggle, so ids must go in *and out* one at a time. That add/remove
requirement is the reason it is a separate service rather than more `mark*Seen`
helpers.

Rules for favourites:

- Go through `favouritesService`; never write a `fav*` field directly.
- Kinds live in `FAVOURITE_KINDS`; the kind → field mapping lives in that
  service. Adding a new favouritable thing means adding one entry to
  `FAVOURITE_FIELDS` and nothing else — fields are created lazily on first
  write, so there is no migration or seeding step.
- Read with `getFavouriteIds(user, kind)` off the AppContext user (synchronous,
  no network). Only use `fetchFavouriteIds` when there is no loaded profile.
- After a `toggleFavourite`, update the AppContext user with
  `favouriteFieldFor(kind)` so the state survives navigation without a re-read.
- Persisting is a whole-array write through the existing `/api/firestore` PUT
  (`updateUserProfile`) — no new endpoint. Concurrent writes from two devices
  can lose one change; that is an accepted trade-off for a favourites list.
- The UI control is `components/ui/FavouriteButton` (controlled: the caller
  owns the state and does the persisting).

## Feature gating: `hidden` vs "granted to nobody"

Features live in `appConfig/config/features` and are gated two independent ways.
Do not conflate them:

- **Grants** (`features` array on each tier in `tiersConfig`) decide who may
  *use* a feature. A feature granted to nobody is still advertised — it renders
  with a "Coming Soon" / "Incoming" badge, because the dashboard doubles as the
  upsell surface.
- **`hidden: true`** on the feature document keeps it out of every listing for
  tiers below VIP: no dashboard tile, no pricing row. This is the launch switch
  for something still under test. VIP (beta channel) and Admin are unaffected.
  It is a listing filter only — it does not gate `canAccess`, so a hidden
  feature stays reachable by direct URL for anyone whose tier grants it.

Anything that lists features must filter first: `useTierAccess().isVisible(key)`
for the viewer, or `isFeatureVisible(feature, tierId)` from
`utils/featureAccess` when asking about a tier other than the viewer's (the
pricing page). Adding a dashboard tile without that filter leaks hidden
features. Toggle the flag in Admin > Features.

## Do not assume

- that a backend exists in this repo
- that a new endpoint should be created here when the API repo already owns the backend
- that there is a test framework in this frontend
- that user-facing content can be hardcoded without checking translation rules
